## Project Structure
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.

- **Model:** Handles the data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the user interface and data to the user.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user inputs and updating the View accordingly.

## Design Patterns
### MVC Architecture
- **Reason:** The MVC architecture was chosen to improve code organization and maintainability. By separating concerns, each component (Model, View, Controller) can be developed and tested independently.

### State Management
- **Reason:** Since most of the state are ephemerial, I used mostly ValueNotifiers and setState to handle them.

## Key Features
### Custom Navigation Bar
- **Reason:** A custom navigation bar was implemented to provide a unique user experience that aligns with the app's branding and design requirements.

### BottomIcon Animations
- **Reason:** Animations were added to the BottomIcon widgets to enhance the user interface's interactivity and visual appeal, providing users with immediate feedback upon interaction.

## Testing
- **Reason:** Writing tests ensures the reliability and stability of the app. Various tests were written to cover integration and widget testing, ensuring that all components work as expected.

### Integration Tests
- **Details:** Integration tests were written to simulate user interactions and verify that the app behaves correctly.

### Widget Tests
- **Details:** Widget tests were created to ensure individual UI components render and function properly.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Animation Performance
- **Challenge:** Ensuring smooth animations without impacting app performance.
- **Solution:** Optimized animation code and used efficient state management techniques to maintain performance.

### Navigation Management
- **Challenge:** Handling complex navigation flows.
- **Solution:** Implemented a robust navigation system that ensures seamless transitions between screens.
